    explanation: "While there is a range for each probe depending on manufacturer, the linear probe is used for structures such as musculoskeletal, vascular, nerve blocks, etc. which require higher frequency and better resolution.  As such, they do not penetrate the tissue far (superficial penetration).  They will have higher frequencies between 5-15 MHz.",

    choices: ["Spine sign", "Seagull Sign", "Seashore Sign", "Sloth Sign"],
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "The first takeoff from the aorta is the celiac trunk which gives rise to the hepatic artery and splenic artery. This branch point gives off the appearance of a seagull flying and is known as the seagull sign. This is the landmark for the proximal aorta. You should measure cranial/proximal to this takeoff for your proximal abdominal aorta measurement.",

    answer: "A",
    explanation: "This is a suprasternal aortic arch view. This visualizes the aorta from above and you can often see the takeoff of 1) the brachiocephalic/innominate artery, 2) the left common carotid artery, and 3) the left subclavian artery.

    answer: "A",
    explanation: "When locating the abdominal aorta to measure (from outer wall to outer wall), you want to ensure you are measuring the correct vessel. The abdominal aorta should just be anterior to the vertebral stripe just adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC). The aorta is on the patient's left when compared to the IVC. At the level of the superior mesenter"

    choices: ["Thrombolysis", "Emergent surgical consultation", "Cardiac catheterization", "Ensuring systolic blood pressure < 220 mmHg", "Pericardiocentesis"],
    answer: "B",
    explanation: "The clip shows an apical 4-chamber view with a dilated aortic outflow tract with a dissection flap noted within the flap.This represents a Type A aortic dissection and definitive management is with emergent surgical intervention(Choice B).There is no obvious finding of RV strain for acute pulmonary embolism nor is there a notable regional wall motion abnormality to suggest thrombolysis(Choice A) or cardiac catheterization(Choice C).Medical management of an aortic dissection, such as aggressive blood pressure control(Choice D).is appropriate for Type B aortic dissections but since this dissection flap is noted in the aortic root in the ascending portion of the aorta, this would not be sufficient.There is no pericardial effusion noted in the clip mandating a pericardiocentesis(Choice E) though this may be a consideration should the dissection reach the pericardium in the imminent future.",

    choices: ["WES sign", "SIN sign", "Porcelain sign", "Murphy's sign", "Shred Sign"],
    answer: "A",
    explanation: "The image demonstrates WES sign (wall-echo-shadow), where there is a large gallstone in a contracted gallbladder. In the video clip, the outer most layer is the gallbladder wall, followed by the hyperechoic gallstone and posterior shadowing. It is important to scan through the gallbladder in two planes either in the subcostal or subphrenic planes to ensure identifying the gallbladder and associated pathologies. ",

    answer: "B",
    explanation: "The duodenum sits in a location very near to the gallbladder. It's tubular structure can often mimic the appearance of the gallbladder. Bowel gas can also have a similar appearance to gallstones, in that it can appear hyperechoic and have posterior shadowing. The gallbladder should however should end in a blind pouch and it's neck will be in the direct vicinity of the portal triad. Always ultrasound in 3 dimensions (short and long axis views) and use adjacent anatomy to clearly define your structure of interest. ",
